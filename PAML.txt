Notes regarding PAML scripts and data from Emily
   locally at Documents/Research/Prunus/Phylogeny/paml_scripts/

codeml.ctl
contains information for PAML on what to do, control file

At_Cr_Np.dnd
contains a Newick-like tree, in case I find it referenced in the scripts or ctl file

PERL scripts

make_multi_fasta.pl
probably do not need this since already have MAFFT_prep.sh script that creates multifasta

translate_fasta.pl
not sure if translation required for our purposes, requires "cds fasta file" (single or multi?)
in pronucalignment.pl some comparison between [fasta protein alignment] and [fasta cDNA sequences (unaligned)]

run_mafft.pl
runs MAFFT on multi fasta, already have script for running mafft, MAFFT_run.sh

pronucalignment.pl
comparison between [fasta protein alignment] and [fasta cDNA sequences (unaligned)]
is this for each sample individually or protein alignment and multifasta of cDNA?

write_dnd_file.pl
creates the dnd file with Newick-like tree, not quite sure the input required
(format of the input tree?)

multipronucalignment.pl
input "[aln list] [cdna list]"
references pronucalignment.pl
looks like it just runs all cdna through the pronucalignment.pl script

run_codeml.pl
input [directory] (treefile)
tree file appears optional and is "none" unless provided on command line
does ls of rundirectory
seems to just go through directory and run each file?
